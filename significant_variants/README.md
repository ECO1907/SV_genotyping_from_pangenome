This folder contains the tables with the significant variants detected by the GWAS methods (GLM and BLINK) for the eight agriculture variants (grain width, grain length, grains per panicle, panicle length, number of panicles, plant height, heading time and allelopathy index) using three datasets (SVs, SNPs and SVs+SNPs). All the tables have the following columns:

Variant ID |	Chromosome	| Position	| Detection method	| Data set	| Variant type	| Length (bp)	| TE*	| Frequency	| P-value-	| Effect+	| Gene(s) in 2 Kb proximity	| Gene(s) coordiantes	| Position(s) respect the gene(s)	| Overlapping related QTL in SNP-seek

TE*: only for SVs. SV annotation as transposable element
P-value-: lowest P-value calculated
Effect+: largest effect calculated
